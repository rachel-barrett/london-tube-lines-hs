/Use Servant
/Structure in a similar way to london-tube-lines scala
/Use an sqlite database client
/Use Resource abstraction
/Use record dot preprocessor

Make tests compile and run
Autogenerate the swagger
Make Resource a monad transformer, or use from a library
Use a database client that is on the current stack resolver
  (maybe it could use quasiquoting to check that sql is correctly typed)
Add tests for breaking changes to the api
Try more complicated serialization and deserialization
Add logging as middleware
Can you encode the api in a GADT?
